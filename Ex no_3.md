## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Declare the variables.
3. Prompt the user to enter a value.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Calculate the number of years using the formula:
6. End .

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <math.h>
int main()
{
float p,n,r,si,ci; 
scanf("%f%f%f", &p,&n,&r);
si=((p*n*r)/100); 
ci=(p)*(pow((1+ r/100),n));
printf("Simple Interest = %0.2f\nCompound Interest = %0.2f", si,ci);
return 0;
}

```

## Output:
